SwiftCare is an innovative iOS application that uses eye-tracking technology to enable patients with limited mobility to communicate their needs effortlessly. The system consists of two interconnected apps: A patient-side iPad app that uses eye-tracking to allow patients to select options like "I need water" or "I need to use the bathroom." A nurse-side iPhone app that receives real-time notifications of patient requests. The app also allows patients to log their level of discomfort at any time. Nurses can view request histories and discomfort analytics in the form of line graphs for each patient, enabling more proactive and data-driven care.
